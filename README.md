# graphql-playlist

This is a fork of the iamshaunjp/graphql-playlist repository.

Jump [here](https://github.com/sitedevente/graphql-playlist/tree/my-branch) to get my version of this project.

Aside from this readme and the new branch **my-branch** no changed were made to the code.

# my-branch

In this branch rests my work but what is different with the previous version ?

 - Code updated to the current apollo client code (now using hooks)
 - Used some light config to not expose my credentials and make setup a bit easier.
 - The design of front-end app is not the same as in the forked version (though very similar)
